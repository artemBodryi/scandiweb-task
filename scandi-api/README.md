# You are in back-end part of my application 

This part has been wrote on APACHE2 server with using PHP and MySQL DB. In next steps I would describe what you should install on your local machine for launch this application:

* You should install PHP on you machine if you have not it. Here is link on official page https://www.php.net/

* Install XAMPP application for launch APACHE2 and MySQL DB. All credentials of server (host and port) and DB (hostname, username, password, db) you can find in ./connection.php

* When all off previous steps would be setup you should run server and DB in XAMPP

* In your browser run http://localhost:3000/ and have enjoy of my application.
