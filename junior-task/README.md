# Front-end part of my application

 This part of my application has been wrote on React.js. In next steps I would explain you what you need to setup for open this application:

* First of all, you need have node on your machine for using npm (node package manager). If you are not have it, you can go to official site https://nodejs.org/en/ and reed how to install it.

* Open your terminal and go to root folder of this application. When you would be in root, write "npm start" and npm would take all dependencies from webpack and install it on your machine.
